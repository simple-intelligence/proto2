Making a git directory play with a ros directory
  - Make your personal ros workspace first
  - [If making repo from scratch]
    - Use roscreate_pkg to create a package space FIRST
    - Then initialize git in package space ONLY
  - [If using already existing git repo]
    - Clone git repo into ros workspace directly
  - **This will keep the git repo clean, keep the ros workspace clean,
    and make it easier to build the package and use other packages**
